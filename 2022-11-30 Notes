Database Security
	Claim of identity
		Ex:
			username
			password
		
			Linux, PAM plugin
			
	GRANT statement - allows you to grant privileges to accounts
	REVOKE statement - revokes privilieges
	
	Can give some subset of privileges for a table or a database to an account
	
	To create an account:
		CREATE USER 'username'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
		
		CREATE USER 'bob'@'localhost'  ...
	
	IMPLICIT account creation:
	
		GRANT USAGE ON db.table
		GRANT USAGE ON *.*
		GRANT USAGE ON db.*
	
		GRANT USAGE ON ev.* TO 'user'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
	
	
	
	DROP USER 'user'@'hostname';
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Tangent - prepared statements, look them up to find out how to prevent sql injection
	Also secure the database
